# Ansible-Homeserver

This Repo is for personal use!

To also install Docker (e.g. on a fresh debian install) uncomment jeff's roles in run.yml

set your variables in group_vars/all and run  
```bash
ansible-playbook run.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

Of course remember to actually delete and recreate the vault file.
